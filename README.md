# Week 6 Python
In Week 6, I utilised the pandas library in Python for data analysis, along with Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisations. I developed insight into comparison operators and created conditional if statements to control program flow based on varying conditions. 

**Knowledge gained:**
- Advantages of using Python in programming
- Python Libraries/Tools (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn)
- Comparison Operators
- Conditional (if) Statements
